A collection of black and white, printable proxies, tokens, and other fun Magic
the Gathering (MtG) cards. Made in Inkscape.

## Generating Art

### GIMP

My technique for producing the main art is to find an acceptable image on the
internet, then perform these steps in GIMP:

1. Open the image in GIMP, usually I use `File > Create > From Clipboard` after
   copying an image from a web browser
1. `Colors > Desaturate > Colors to Gray ...` and accept the default settings
1. For additional scuff and less printer ink, try `Filters > Distorts >
   Newsprint ...` and play with the settings (I like `Period = 5`)
